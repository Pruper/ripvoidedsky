            On 17 February 2024, at approximately 1:28 AM UTC, the VoidedSky Minecraft server, originally known as EarthCraft, was officially deleted, marking the end of a server which had existed since shortly after the 2022 Reddit r/place experiment. Its community grew out of people heralding from communities such as The Blue Corner and American Flag In Place, eventually becoming so much more than just r/place participants.
            <br><br>
            VoidedSky at its peak, boasted a dedicated staff team and a playerbase of nearly one thousand unique individuals, who stuck together for six seasons of gameplay. Factions such as TBC, USSR, CES, Imperium, and RDS made their rise on this server, and their members would continue to maintain cohesion in the server's subsequent seasons. While the server eventually declined, much of the community would eventually unite under the banner of the Roman Empire on another survival server known as Dominia.
            <br><br>
            Propaganda was spread, wars were fought, events were held, outlaws were banished, memories were created and friendships were forged on this basic Minecraft earth map.
            <br><br>
            To any former VoidedSky player who may stumble across this in the future, thank you.
